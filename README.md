# ThirdReality Relay Module

The relay module supports Matter protocols, is suitable for power switch control scenarios in various circuits. You can use any app that supports Matter, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, SmartThings , ThirdReality app or Matter Chip-Tool to communicate with the Module. Simultaneously utilizing various intelligent speakers, such as HomePod/mini, Google Nest/Display, Amazon Echo/Dot,  you can also easily control the Relay through voice interaction.

The relay module has passed CSA Matter 1.1 certification，RF and other hardware indicators certification, ensuring its safety. It is small enough in size to easily embed into your product, allowing it to immediately integrate into the Matter ecosystem. The standard OTA upgrade of Matter can continuously ensure that your relay firmware updates are synchronized with Matter upgrades.

A single module supports up to 3 independent relay controls, and this configuration on the module can be changed through four combinations of two resistors. Then, the pre-burned firmware will recognize the hardware changes and complete the dynamic configuration.

## Connect the relay module to a USB to UART board

| PIN (relay module) | PIN (USB to UART board) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| V                  | VCC (3.3V)              |
| G                  | GND                     |
| RX                 | TXD                     |
| TX                 | RXD                     |

The hardware wiring can refer to the following diagram

<img src="README.assets/image-20230620121811312.png" alt="image-20230620121811312" style="zoom:80%;" />



## Connect UART board to computer USB port

Set serial port parameters as the following

<img src="README.assets/image-20230620121032706.png" alt="image-20230620121032706" style="zoom: 80%;" />

***Pay attention to serial port baudrate 2000000***



## Burning Process

1. Connect the relay module GPIO8(Boot)  to 3.3V pin on the UART board,  power on relay

2. Copy the previously compiled bin file "thirdreality-relay. bin"

3. run BLDevCube.exe ( at burning tool directory ) on Windows OS

4. Set parameters as shown in the following screenshot 

   ```
   You can get partition table file from this repository, relay_mt/tools-3r/firmware/bl602/,
   
   dts and boot2 from the burning tool,
   
   firmware from the build.
   ```

   

5. click Create & Download button

6. wait until the progress bar is 100%, which means the burning is completed

## Get QR code

After burning reset relay, from the uart log, copy URL similar to the following:
https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A-24J0-C714W80648G00

Open the URL above with a browser, and normally, there will be a QR code on the screen

# Control Relay



## Plug into the smart socket ESP-01S Relay base

The Relay module can be directly plugged into the ESP-01S relay smart socket, which is powered by 5V DC, then  you can experience pin to pin compatibility and immediately work.
